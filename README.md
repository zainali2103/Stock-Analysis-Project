# Stock Analysis - Apple

## Project Overview
This project leverages Apple's stock price data to analyze stock trends using the 30-day and 100-day rolling averages.

The analysis allows for a better understanding of underlying trends and helps to navigate the dynamic stock market.

## Technologies Used
